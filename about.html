    <div class="col-md-6"><p class="repinfo">The "reputation" album was made following the events of 2016 where Taylor Swift saw a dramatic shift in how the world viewed her. Following accusations involving a situation with Kanye West and his now former wife Kim Kardashian, Swift found herself in a position where she was made out to be a liar. This led the world to jump on the opportunity to hate on Swift and "cancel" her. Swift spent over a year with no social media interaction and no public sightings. She spent her time out of the public eye growing as a person and creating the album "reputation." The announcement of the album came by Swift deleting everything on her Instagram, as though she was starting anew. "Reputation" was Taylor Swift's chance to make or break her career. She had one chance to return to the public eye and she did so successfully. The album was a hit and later in 2020, the truth about the controversy involving West and Kardashian came to light, proving Swift had been truthful all along. Although the album may seem like it focuses on revenge and all the hate Swift received, it truly focuses on growth and finding out who the people who really care for her are. During a time when the world hated on Taylor Swift, she found Joe Alwyn, who has been with Swift for around 7 years. The album is a reflection as to how one can make the best out of a bad situation and use it to grow.</p></div>
