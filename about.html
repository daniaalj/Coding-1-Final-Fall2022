    <div class="col-md-6"><p class="repinfo">Whenever Taylor announces she's releasing a new album, it symbolises a fresh start for her. Famously, with "1989", she cut off her hair, moved to New York City and officially made the transition from country sweetheart to pop superstar. In the days prior to the announcement of "reputation", her entire online presence was blacked out, deleting everything but three mysterious videos that were posted to her Instagram and Twitter accounts, apparently depicting a writhing snake. This led fans to speculate that Taylor was attempting to reclaim the "snake" image she was branded with after the public feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. Her first "reputation" single, “Look What You Made Me Do” declared the “old Taylor dead”. When the album was released on November 10, 2017, it scored colossal numbers upon its eventual release, selling 1,28 million copies in its first week in the US, making Taylor the only artist in history to have four albums debut with over a million first-week sales. During the "reputation" era, apart from when she was playing shows, Taylor basically completely stopped making public appearances. She had been a regular fixture at awards shows since the beginning of her career, but starting with the release of "reputation", she mostly remained absent from red carpets. And it wasn't just awards shows. She was also rarely spotted by the paparazzi, which was a stark contrast when you consider that a couple of years prior, barely a day went by without Taylor being photographed.</p></div>
